\title{Build grid used for weights in distilled surrogate model}
\usage{
build.grid(
  object,
  feat.ind = 1:length(object$features),
  save = T,
  fit.train = T
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{The Interpreter object}

\item{feat.ind}{The indices of the features in the Interpreter's features that we want
to include as PDP functions in the distilled model.}

\item{save}{Boolean for saving the results in the interpreter object. Default is TRUE.}

\item{fit.train}{Boolean for indicating whether we fit to the subsampled training
data or to all possible combinations of the grid.points. Default
is TRUE, which means that we use the subsampled training data.}
}
\value{
A dataframe used to find weights in regression (one-hot encoding for
        categorical features)
}
\description{
A dataframe storing the true predictions and the PDP predictions
}
